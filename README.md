# apt-name-generator_heroku
Roll a randomly generated advanced persistent threat (APT) group name.

We all know about the 500 Pandas and 50 Bears. Where do these names come from? Well, some researchers have documented that and that's not why this script exists.

The word sets are primarily based on real APT group names with some campaign & toolset names thrown in for funsies.
Styling retained if all caps were used (typically USG labels).

Syntax:
Adjective + Noun = APT_Group_Name

Example Rolls:

- Crouching Turtle
- Tempting Bear
- Energetic Lotus
- Toxic PRESIDENT
- Inky Dickens
- El Chollima
- Grey GIRL
- Wicked Romance
- Domestic Team
- GOSSIP Eyes
- Labyrinth Spy

Ported to Heroku in lieu of mandating CLI for APT funsies.
